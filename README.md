# Project Outline

This project is intended as an educational tool to teach fundamental programming skills through the medium of Virtual Reality.

The project takes inspiration from existing educational tools like Blockly and Scratch, while extending the metaphor of block-based
programming to the third dimension.

## Principals

The project should be progressive, introducing simple constructs and functionality, and using them to build grandually more complex algorithms to achieve specific goals.

The project should be relevant to computer science. It may introduce concepts using toy examples, but ultimately it should
teach practical and realistic examples that can be applied to real programs.

The project should be fun. Programming is a complex, and often extremely dry subject. Introducing the concept to children and
adult beginners in a way that is engaging, is perhaps a never-ending endeavor for computer science educators. This project
should employ the techniques of game design to create real motivation to solve the given problems.
Progression systems, achievements, unlockables, and easter eggs are all viable mechanisms to engage players.
